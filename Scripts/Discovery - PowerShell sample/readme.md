# Automate uploading logs to Defender for Cloud Apps Cloud Discovery

This sample guide/scripts will help you automate uploading firewall logs to Defender for Cloud Apps using API.
This helps eliminate the need to deploy a log collector, and makes it more flexible to deploy and maintain.

In addition, this guide is using the Microsoft Graph API, instead of the legacy Defender for Cloud Apps APIs, which is in a path to being deprecated in the future.
